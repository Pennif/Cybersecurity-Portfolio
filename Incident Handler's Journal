Description: First incident response requirement from google's cybersecurity certificate.
             This mock-attack is about a health care clinic that got ransomwared via phising
             link. 
The 5 w's:   Who: an employee clicked on a phising link sent by email. Further, there was an 
             unethical hacker group who created the ransomware that was deployed.
             What: Ransomware incident
             Where: Health care company, US
             When: Tuesday, 09:00
             Why: An employee clicked on a phising link from an email. This downloaded a file which
             gave the group access to the companies systems. The group promptly uploaded a ransomware
             attack - money for a decyrption key.
Additional Notes:
             Please ensure that all employees are up to date on the latest cybersecurity phising threats

Description: Second incident response requirement from google's cybersecurity certificate.
             This mock-attack is about an employee who downloaded and opened a malicious file from
             an email. The sender of the email was pretending to be interested in a role at the company
             and the attachment had a known malicious hash.
             Further evidence escalates the likelyhood of an attack (if the hash wasn't obvious enough):
             the file contained a password protected .exe, and there were grammaritical mistakes in the
             body of the email.
             The course recommends the outcome to be " pass this problem onto a higher up analyst", which
             is dissappointing.
