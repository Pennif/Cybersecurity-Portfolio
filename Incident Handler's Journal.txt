Description: First incident response requirement from google's cybersecurity certificate.
             This mock-attack is about a health care clinic that got ransomwared via phising
             link. 
The 5 w's:   Who: an employee clicked on a phising link sent by email. Further, there was an 
             unethical hacker group who created the ransomware that was deployed.
             What: Ransomware incident
             Where: Health care company, US
             When: Tuesday, 09:00
             Why: An employee clicked on a phising link from an email. This downloaded a file which
             gave the group access to the companies systems. The group promptly uploaded a ransomware
             attack - money for a decyrption key.
Additional Notes:
             Please ensure that all employees are up to date on the latest cybersecurity phising threats
             Payment may be made.

Description: Second incident response requirement from google's cybersecurity certificate.
             This mock-attack is about an employee who downloaded and opened a malicious file from
             an email. The sender of the email was pretending to be interested in a role at the company
             and the attachment had a known malicious hash.
             Further evidence escalates the likelyhood of an attack (if the hash wasn't obvious enough):
             the file contained a password protected .exe, and there were grammaritical mistakes in the
             body of the email.
             The course recommends the outcome to be " pass this problem onto a higher up analyst", which
             is dissappointing.

Description: The following is a mock final report of a security incident invovling a data breach. It is
                   as training in report writing.
              
              INCIDENT FINAL REPORT
              
              Executive Summary:
              
              On December 28, 2022, at 7:20 p.m. PT, our organization encountered a security breach leading
              to unauthorized access to customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data. This incident 
              impacted approximately 50,000 customer records, resulting in an estimated $100,000 in direct costs and 
              potential revenue loss. Following a thorough investigation, the incident has been resolved.
              
              Timeline:
              
              December 22, 2022, 3:13 p.m. PT: An employee received an email from an external address claiming successful theft 
              of customer data, demanding a $25,000 cryptocurrency payment to prevent data release. The email was disregarded as 
              spam and deleted.
              December 28, 2022: The same employee received a second email from the same sender containing a sample of stolen 
              customer data and a demand for $50,000.
              Upon receipt of the second email, the employee alerted the security team, initiating the investigation phase between
              December 28 and December 31, 2022.
              Investigation:
              
              Upon notification, the security team promptly commenced an on-site investigation. They identified the root cause as a 
              vulnerability within the e-commerce web application.
              The vulnerability facilitated a forced browsing attack, enabling the attacker to access customer transaction data by 
              modifying the order number in the URL string of a purchase confirmation page.
              Analysis revealed that the attacker exploited this vulnerability to access and exfiltrate data from thousands of customer
              purchase confirmation pages.
              
              Response and Remediation:
              
              The organization, in collaboration with the public relations department, disclosed the breach to affected customers and provided complimentary                      identity protection services.
              A review of web server logs confirmed the source of the attack, characterized by an unusually high volume of sequentially listed customer orders.
              Recommendations:
              
              To mitigate future risks, the following measures will be implemented:
              
              Conduct routine vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
              Deploy access control mechanisms, including:
              Implementation of allowlisting to restrict access to specified URLs and automatically block requests beyond this range.
              Ensuring that only authenticated users have access to content.
